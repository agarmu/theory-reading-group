This is the webpage for the Summer 2025 Theory Reading Group at Purdue University. The purpose of this group is for a group of students to discuss topics in Theoretical CS (Algorithms, Computational Complexity, etc.) which are not covered in a typical undergraduate/first graduate course. Though we are mostly student-run, [Prof. Kent Quanrud](https://kentquanrud.com/) is also helping out. 

## Logistics

We will meet once a week from the Week of June 16 to the Week of August 18; depending on interest, we will continue to meet during future semesters.
Depending on what portion of attendees are on campus, we will adjust the format of our meeting; tentatively, we will have meetings be a hybrid between in-person
and online.

We are currently considering following [Anupam Gupta's **Advanced Algorithms, Spring 2023** (CMU 15-580)](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/academic/class/15850-s23/www/oldindex.html).

Any Purdue Students who are interested should fill out the following google form: [https://forms.gle/qwQcFfziReXcGMJ89](https://forms.gle/qwQcFfziReXcGMJ89).

*For any questions/concerns please email Mukul Agarwal at [agarw396@purdue.edu](mailto:agarw396@purdue.edu).*
