This is the webpage for the Summer 2025 Theory Reading Group at Purdue University. The purpose of this group is for a group of students to discuss topics in Theoretical CS (Algorithms, Computational Complexity, etc.) which are not covered in a typical undergraduate/first graduate course. Though we are mostly student-run, [Prof. Kent Quanrud](https://kentquanrud.com/) is also helping out. 

## Logistics

We will likely meet once a week from the Week of June 9 to the Week of August 18; depending on interest, we will continue to meet during future semesters.
Depending on what portion of attendees are on campus, we will adjust the format of our meeting; tentatively, we will have meetings be a hybrid between in-person
and online.

We are currently considering following one of the following courses:
- [Anupam Gupta's **Advanced Algorithms, Spring 2023** (CMU 15-580)](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/academic/class/15850-s23/www/oldindex.html)
- [Serge Plotkin's **Advanced Algorithms, Spring 2014** (Stanford CS361B)](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs361b/)
- [Jelani Nelson's **Combinatorial Algorithms and Data Structures, Spring 2023** (Berkeley CS270)](https://cs270.org/spring23/home/)
- [Pravesh K. Kothari's **Advanced Algorithm Design, Fall 2024** (Princeton COS 521)](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall24/cos521/)
- Other courses/special topics suggested by reading group members.

Any Purdue Students who are interested should fill out the following google form: [https://forms.gle/qwQcFfziReXcGMJ89](https://forms.gle/qwQcFfziReXcGMJ89).
